# Global settings applied to the whole site.

# “base” is the directory to change to before starting build. If you set base:
#        that is where we will look for package.json/.nvmrc/etc, not repo root!
# “command” is your build command.
# “publish” is the directory to publish (relative to the root of your repo).

[build]

  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist/angryraids"

# Branch deploy context: All deploys that are not in
# an active Deploy Preview will inherit these settings.
