  <h4>What is AngryRaids?</h4>
  <p>AngryRaids is an equipment simulator for King's Raid.</p>
  <h4>Why do we need this?</h4>
  <p>This is for people who are gung-ho about their builds and wanting to see how it will turn out before farming them.</p>
  <h4>Isn't excel good enough for this?</h4>
  <p>Yes, but there are people who can't use excel in a good way.</p>
  <h4>Why isn't there enough information about each hero?</h4>
  <p>
    This thing solves equipment simulation, for the lack of hero information,
    there is <a href="https://maskofgoblin.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MaskOfGoblin</a> for that.
